# Python-programs
some successful programs i made, decided to share them, more to come.
All the exercises and programs i make are not my ideas but already existed ideas
I just am interrested in coding them and see how far i can go
Please enjoy and tell me if something needs changing or improving
Note: These Files are written in python 2.X and therefore will not work
with Python 3.X or etc. Please bare this in mind when editing or testing these scripts.
